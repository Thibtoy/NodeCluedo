Welcome on my online cluedo project, to start using it, you need to have node package manager installed on your environment.

Download the repository, then, open it in your terminal, at the root of the repository, tap `npm install`, wait the end of the installation, then, run the project with `npm start`.

Go to http://localhost:8000/, click on the button, you're now on the lobby page of your cluedo game, waiting for another player to join the game.

Open a second window on http://localhost:8000/, click on the button, you're now joining the first lobby, two players are in the lobby, both windows are redirected to the game corresponding, the lobby is closed, if you're tryin to open a third game you'll be in a new lobby for a new game with another player.

(you may have to refresh one of the page, because of opening it on the same screen (having two reduced windows helps to keep focus on both));

Once you're in game, one of the windows will have hand to play, everything that will appear on the playin player's screen (except the hided one's) will appear on the other screen.

I still get a lot of work to do on it, but it will progressively get better and better.

Enjoy  =)  Cabanes Thibault.
